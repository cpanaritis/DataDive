# Code Jam: DataDive
#### By Alexander, Christos, Karine and Sadhvi 

The idea behind the project was to be able to link bitcoin price changes to news articles. Having scrapped google news and new york times and other news outlets for headlines (as well as there publication date) related and not related to bitcoin, we produced enough data to implement a machine learning algorithm that would be able to predict how a headline might affect the price of bitcoin. <br />

This program takes in as input a headline (typed by the user) and returns how that headline might affect the price of bitcoin. <br />

Application: Having an aproximated change in price could be used to help people invest in bitcoin by minimizing losses as well as maximizing profits.
